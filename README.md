Bards Ballad is a on the go interactive character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons. Currently set up for 5th Edition, the player would have the ability to generate a character, and made the adjustments as they wish. Once generated the player can set skills, weapons, and etc. Each item is meant to be interactive and intuitive, with out the need of paper or dice (I do prefer dice myself).

Some future plans:
1. Create the api to store the game logic
2. Add leveling capabilities for character
3. Add ability to save multiple characters

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone it down

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

**Install Homebrew**

``` /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ```

You'll be using this to install any major tech such as Node or Postgres. Real rangers use Homebrew~

**Install node via Homebrew**

``` brew install node```

This will add node and npm. Neat~

**This app runs on PORT 4000**

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

After forking and cloning to your local computer:

1. Install dependencies with ``` npm install```
2. Build the bundle with webpack ```npm run prod``` for production ```npm run dev``` for development
3. Start the server with ```npm start``` for production or ```npm run server``` for development


## Running the tests

To see if the tests are passing:
``` npm test ```
