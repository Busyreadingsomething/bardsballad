# Bards Ballad

Bards Ballad is a on the go interactive character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons. Currently set up for 5th Edition, the player would have the ability to generate a character, and made the adjustments as they wish. Once generated the player can set skills, weapons, and etc. Each item is meant to be interactive and intuitive, with out the need of paper or dice (I do prefer dice myself).

Some future plans:
1. Create the api to store the game logic
2. Add leveling capabilities for character
3. Add ability to save multiple characters
